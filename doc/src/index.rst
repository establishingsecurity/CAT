Welcome to cat's documentation!
===============================

The Cryptographic Attack Toolkit is a library implementing and explaining attacks in a general way.

We expect cat to be useful in three different domains:

1. During Capture The Flag (CTF) contests while implementing attacks on cryptographic challenges
2. During penetration tests in attacking custom cryptographic implementations, and
3. As a reference for people that want to learn about cryptanalysis, by providing documentation and ready to use attacks.

Non-functional requirements and cross-cutting concerns are a major part of this project.
The main ones are the following:

- Offer a uniform interface to analyses and attacks
- Consolidation of attacks against primitives
- Attacks are accompanied by thorough and comprehensible documentation
- Each attack is documented by an accompanying tutorial in a corresponding attack-scenario
- Progress is saved periodically or between stages during long running attacks
- Extensible and modular architecture
- The framework can be used in Python 3

Installation
------------

Soon you should be able to :code:`pip install <InsertPyPi Name>`. For now, refer to :file:`CONTRIBUTE.md` for installation instructions.
